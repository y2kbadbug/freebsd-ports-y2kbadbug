crowdsec-firewall-bouncer is installed.

The bouncer should register itself but you may want to check the
configuration file, which is now in %%ETCDIR%%/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.yaml
(for consistency with the other platforms).

In previous versions, the configuration was in /usr/local/etc/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer, you may need
to check if you made any changes there.

This package depends on the Packet Filter service.
To make sure it's active:

----------
# sysrc pf_enable=YES
pf_enable: NO -> YES
# service pf start
Enabling pf.
----------

Then activate the bouncer via sysrc:

----------
# sysrc crowdsec_firewall_enable="YES"
crowdsec_firewall_enable: NO -> YES
# service crowdsec_firewall start
----------

After a few seconds, the bouncer should have created the tables and rules:

----------
# pfctl -s Tables
crowdsec-blacklists
crowdsec6-blacklists
# pfctl -s Tables -s rules
block drop in quick from <crowdsec-blacklists> to any
block drop in quick from <crowdsec6-blacklists> to any
----------
