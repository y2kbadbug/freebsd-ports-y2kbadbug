crowdsec-firewall-bouncer is installed.

The bouncer should register itself but you may want to check the
configuration file, which is now in %%ETCDIR%%/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.yaml
(for consistency with the other platforms).

In previous versions, the configuration was in /usr/local/etc/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer, you may need
to check if you made any changes there.

If it's the first time, you need to edit your Packet Filter configuration.
Add the following in /etc/pf.conf to create the tables:

----------
# create crowdsec ipv4 table
table <crowdsec-blacklists> persist

# create crowdsec ipv6 table
table <crowdsec6-blacklists> persist

block drop in quick from <crowdsec-blacklists> to any
block drop in quick from <crowdsec6-blacklists> to any
----------

To apply the file:

# pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

Then activate the bouncer via sysrc:

# sysrc crowdsec_firewall_enable="YES"
EOM
}
]
