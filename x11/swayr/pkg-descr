Swayr consists of a demon, and a client. The demon swayrd records
window/workspace creations, deletions, and focus changes using sway's
JSON IPC interface. The client swayr offers subcommands, see swayr
--help, and sends them to the demon which executes them.

Right now, there are these subcommands:
* next-window focuses the next window in depth-first iteration order of the
  tree.
* prev-window focuses the previous window in depth-first iteration order of
  the tree.
* switch-window displays all windows in the order urgent first, then
  last-recently-used, focused last and focuses the selected.
* quit-window displays all windows and quits the selected one.
* switch-to-urgent-or-lru-window switches to the next window with urgency
  hint (if any) or to the last recently used window.
* switch-workspace displays all workspaces in LRU order and switches to the
  selected one.
* switch-workspace-or-window displays all workspaces and their windows and
   switches to the selected workspace or window.
* quit-workspace-or-window displays all workspaces and their windows and
  allows to quit either the selected workspace (all its windows) or the
  selected window.
* execute-swaymsg-command displays most swaymsg which don't require
  additional input and executes the selected one. That's handy especially for
  less often used commands not bound to a key.
* execute-swayr-command displays all commands above and executes the selected
  one. (This is useful for accessing swayr commands which are not bound to a
  key.)
