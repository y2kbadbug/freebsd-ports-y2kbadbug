Since many users have reported their devices do not (yet) support SMS history, 
a simple legacy UI has been added until these problems can be fixed. 

Currently this must be enabled manually with the command:
`dconf write /org/gnome/shell/extensions/gsconnect/device/<device-id>/plugin/sms/legacy true`

You can get a list of <device-id>'s with the following command:
`dconf read /org/gnome/shell/extensions/gsconnect/devices`

To integrate with your browser, you will need to install the proper extension
