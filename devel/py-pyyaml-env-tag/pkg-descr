This package was inspired by the Ruby package "yaml-env-tag".  Its main
purpose is to reference environment variables in YAML scripts.

In contrast to other Python packages, that provide similar functionality, e.g.
"pyyaml-tags" it also offers to define defaults and to have the values not only
as strings.
