Configuring Synapse:

The following command can be used to generate a sample configuration of synapse:

%%PYTHON_CMD%% -B -m synapse.app.homeserver -c %%ETCDIR%%/homeserver.yaml --generate-config -H <SERVER_NAME> --report-stats no

Please note that you will still need to manually configure paths to log
directory, database, and media storage with this method.

Synapse 1.51.0 deprecates webclient listeners and non-HTTP(S)
web_client_location settings. Please update your homeserver configurations
accordingly.

Additionally, if you run your own turn server for WebRTC and
use Let's Encrypt certificates, be advised that some Android and iOS clients
may be unable to connect. Please see upstream's turn-howto[0] for additional
details on this issue.
