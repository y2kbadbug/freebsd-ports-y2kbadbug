  message: <<EOM

%%PORTNAME%% relies on Microsoft dotNET5+ SDK to be built
Microsoft does not have an official version of dotNET for FreeBSD

This package was built with an UNOFFICIAL UNSUPPORTED version of dotNET
If this is something that you do not want, remove this package with
"pkg remove %%PORTNAME%%"

This package installs a service file.
Enable it with "sysrc %%PORTNAME%%_enable=TRUE"
Start it with "service %%PORTNAME%% start".

The service file uses daemon to restart %%PORTNAME%% if it crashes.
The service file will also change the permissions so that the updater works.
If this behavior is unwanted you will need to edit the RC file manually and
remove the daemon and/or the permissions changes.

If you are running this in a jail please set "allow_mlock=1" or similar
for this jail otherwise the program will fail to start

Finally, while the built-in updater will update %%PORTNAME%% it has side-effects:
it breaks the ability of pkg to check for corruption in %%PORTNAME%% files
it breaks the ability of pkg to determine if it has removed files correctly
during "pkg remove %%PORTNAME%%" and also
it breaks the fundamental understanding that updates should be handled only
by the system that put the files there in the first place.
